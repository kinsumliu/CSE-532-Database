Brief description: Provide instructions on how to run the query
I pledge my honor that all parts of this project were done by me alone and 
without collaboration with anybody else

Files:
data - tss.xml
schema - tss_schema.xsd
query - tss_queryX.xquery X:{1,2,3,4a,4b,5}

Instruction:
Create a web application on exist-db with the name tss-collection.
Put data, schema and queries files under /db/apps/tss-collection.
In eXide, open the queries and click "Run" or "Eval".
Results are shown in the window.
